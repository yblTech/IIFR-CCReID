## Project Overview
This project contains the code implementation for Isolating Interference Factors for Robust Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification, which explores Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification. It provides code for reproducing the experiments presented in the paper.

## Framework Overview
Below is a high-level framework diagram of the proposed method:

## Dependencies
This code runs in the following environment:

- Python Version: 3.8+
- CUDA Version: 11.8+ (for GPU execution)
- Required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Data Preparation
Follow these steps to prepare the dataset:
1. Download the dataset [DeepChange, LTCC, LaST, PRCC, VC-Clothes].
2. Extract the dataset into the `datasets/` directory.
3. Ensure the data is structured as follows:
   ```
   datasets/
   ├── LTCC_ReID/
   ├── LaST/
   ├── prcc/
   ├── VC-Clothes/
   ```

## Running the Code
### Train the Model
```bash
sh run.sh
```

### Only DSIFLF
```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 --master_port 12345 main-dsif.py --dataset ... --cfg ... --gpu 0,1
```

### Generate Description
```bash
python caption/generate.py 
```
